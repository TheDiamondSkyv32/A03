**Commit** - creates a snapshot of your repository at a specific time in history. (one step before pushing to github)
 
**Fetch** - lets you download commits, files, and references from a remote repository into your local repository without merging those changes into your own branch(es).

**GIT** - free open source distributed version control system, used for source code management and is efficient for managing code between multiple engineers. 

**Github** - a software development platform uesd for storing, tracking, and collaborating on sotware projects (typically with multiple other software engineers).

**Merge** - combines several sequences of commits into one large commit and merges it into the default branch.

**Merge Conflict** - occurs when you merge branches that have competing commits and Git needs your help to choose what changes to keep in the final merge stage.

**Push** - sending committed changes in your local repository to the remote repository on Github.

**Pull** - lets others know about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repo on Github and it allows for a discussion / review of the code with collaborators before changes are merged into the base (main) branch.
